### Fullstack-nanodegree-neighborhood-map project


## About the project
---
* This is a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood I like to visit.

## Instructions (mandatory)
---
* Download the files to the local system.
* Open the index.html file in the browser.

## Features
---
* Use of knockout.js
* Google Maps API
* Wikipedia API

Using Wikipedia API, we have generated wikipedia URLs related to the place. In the info window of a place, when we click the link - 'Click for more info', we get directed to the page containing the information about the location.

By using knockout.js, we have implemented the search feature. On typing an alphabet in the search box in side bar, gives us the list of the available places starting with the same alphabet.

On clicking on a place in the list, activates the info window on the marker of that place.
